# Primum Stilla: Founder's Build Checklist

Saeed, since you are building the **Primum Stilla** flagship yourself, this checklist is your "Code of Excellence." It ensures that every hour you spend coding translates into a world-class agency presence.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Technical Foundation
**Set up the environment for peak performance.**

- [ ] **Strict TypeScript**: Ensure `tsconfig.json` has `strict: true`. No shortcuts with `any` types.
- [ ] **Next.js 14+ Architecture**: Use the App Router and modularize your components in `src/components/`.
- [ ] **Global Styling**: Define your "Deep Space" theme in `tailwind.config.ts` (Midnight Navy, Electric Cyan).
- [ ] **Environment Security**: Use `.env.local` for all API keys and never push them to GitHub.

---

## 🎨 Phase 2: Visual Implementation (The "Wow" Factor)
**This is where you prove your technical dominance.**

- [ ] **The Liquid Hero**: Implement the Three.js morphing droplet. It must be smooth and react to the cursor.
- [ ] **Glassmorphic UI**: Build reusable "GlassCard" components with subtle backdrop blurs and border glows.
- [ ] **Typography Mastery**: Integrate *Cal Sans* for headings and *Inter* for body text.
- [ ] **Micro-animations**: Use Framer Motion for scroll-reveal effects and hover states on all buttons.

---

## 📄 Phase 3: Content & Authority
**Transform your experience into agency milestones.**

- [ ] **Case Studies**: Re-frame your past projects as "Primum Stilla R&D" or "Strategic Solutions." Focus on **ROI and Results**.
- [ ] **Service Verticals**: Clearly define your 3 core pillars: AI Solutions, Web Engineering, and E-commerce.
- [ ] **The Vision**: Write the "About" section as a manifesto for the "First Drop" of innovation.

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Optimization & Launch
**The difference between a "site" and a "platform."**

- [ ] **Lighthouse Audit**: Aim for 95+ in Performance, Accessibility, and SEO.
- [ ] **Cloudflare Shield**: Connect your domain and enable the WAF and "Always Use HTTPS."
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment**: Set up automatic deployments from your `main` branch.
- [ ] **Professional Contact Flow**: Ensure the contact form is connected to your professional email (`saeed@primumstilla.com`).

---

## 📈 Phase 5: Post-Launch Growth
- [ ] **Analytics**: Integrate Vercel Analytics to see where your international visitors are coming from.
- [ ] **Lead Magnet**: Add a "Free AI Audit" or "Strategy Guide" download to capture emails.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Founder's Mindset**: You are building a **machine** that generates trust. Every line of code should make a CEO in London feel like they've found the right partner.
